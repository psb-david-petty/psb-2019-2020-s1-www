<article><p>The Toronto Raptors have made sure Kyle Lowry's stay with the franchise lasts just a bit longer.
According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Raptors and Lowry have agreed to a one-year, $31 million contract extension that will keep him from entering next year's free-agent market. Lowry, who last signed an extension with the Raptors in 2017, has spent the last seven seasons in Toronto. Agent Mark Bartelstein on Monday confirmed the agreement to The Associated Press.</p>

    <article><p>ATLANTA (AP) — <mark>Zion Williamson</mark> may not be quite as tall as billed.
He still soared in his first NBA preseason game Monday night.
Showing off the high-flying talents that made him one of the most anticipated rookies in years, Williamson turned in a ferocious slam less than 2 minutes into his debut with the New Orleans Pelicans and dunked it two more times before the first half was done against the Atlanta Hawks.</p></article>

    <article><p>Dallas Mavericks forward Kristaps Porzingis will have to wait at least one more day to make his preseason debut with the team.
Coach Rick Carlisle told reporters at Tuesday's shootaround the Porzingis will not play against the Oklahoma City Thunder at the BOK Center in Tulsa, Okla. However, Porzingis is expected to suit up on Wednesday when the Mavs visit the Detroit Pistons (7 ET, NBA League Pass). The team had planned on keeping Porzingis out of back-to-back games in the preseason.</p></article>
