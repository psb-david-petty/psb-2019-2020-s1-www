        <h>MTR CNR Changchun EMU</h>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/C-Train_going_to_Yau_Ma_Tei.JPG" alt="MTR CNR Changchun EMU" width=700>
<p>The Changchun EMU or CNR Changchun EMU is an electric multiple unit train type of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system in Hong Kong. It is designed and manufactured by Changchun Railway Vehicles, a member of CNR group (now part of CRRC Corporation). They were the first MTR heavy-rail stock to be manufactured in Mainland China, while past orders came from England, Japan, Europe or South Korea.
The trains come in two versions: the C-Train, a manned eight-car train which is used mainly on the Kwun Tong line[3]; and the S-Train, a driverless three-car variant which operates on the South Island line since its opening in December 2016. Similar trains have been ordered for the future East West Corridor, also known as EWL C-Train, which entered service on the Ma On Shan line on 12 March 2017; however, these trains bear a resemblance to the older SP1900 EMUs.</p>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/MTR-Tung-Chung-line.jpg" alt="MTR Adtranz–CAF EMU" width=700>
<p>The Adtranz-CAF EMU (also known as CAF-Train or LAR-Train) is an Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) train that operates on the MTR rapid transit railway system in Hong Kong. There are two variants, one used on the conventional Tung Chung line, and a more luxurious version used on the Airport Express. The vehicle interiors were designed for MTR by Jones Garrard, while the vehicle exterior and driver's cab interior were designed by Design Triangle, and the First Two Mod Cab with Passenger interior were built by Diara Design. These two variations are built jointly by Adtranz (acquired by Bombardier Transportation in 2001) and Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) and manufactured in Spain in 1996-7.</p>

<p>The SP1900 EMU / SP1950 EMU or IKK Train (formerly KCR EMU SP1900 / SP1950 EMU; 港鐵伊藤忠近畿川崎列車, also known as the Millennium Train during the public promotion) is a model of train that runs on Hong Kong's East Rail Line, West Rail Line and Ma On Shan Line. It was the second model of electric multiple unit rolling stock of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) (after the Metro Cammell EMU, introduced in the 1980s).
The trains were delivered in several phases. The phases have different model numbers but an identical appearance. The models numbers include: SP1900, SP1950, KRS991 and 1151. Unless specified, the name SP1900 would apply to describe all the model numbers in this article. Another model, 1141A (MTR CRRC Changchun EMU), is similar in design to the SP1900, but was built by a different manufacturer and has a slightly different appearance. After the rail merger, the KCR logos on the SP1900 EMU were replaced with those of MTR, and a revised route map was introduced in the train interiors.</p>

        <p>The Light Rail, also known as the Light Rail Transit (LRT), is a light rail system in Hong Kong, serving the northwestern New Territories, within Tuen Mun District and Yuen Long District. The system operates over 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in) standard gauge gauge track, using 750 V DC overhead power supply. It was once one of four systems comprising the KCR network in Hong Kong. It has a daily ridership of about 483,000 people.</p>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/KTT_train.jpg" alt="KTT">
<p>KTT (Chinese: 九廣通)) is a train set used by the MTR Corporation Limited in Hong Kong on the Guangdong Through Train (KCRC) route. The KTT is not the only service from Hong Kong to Guangdong. Service is also provided by the mainland Chinese railway operators.
The double-deck "KTT" trailers have lower bottom floor than the ordinary cars serving on the same pair of tracks.</p>
<p>The Re 460 (popularly known as the Lok 2000) series are modern four-axle electric locomotives of the Swiss Federal Railways. Upon their entry into service in the early 1990s, they replaced the Ae 3/6I [de], Ae 4/7 and Re 4/4I [de] series units, and displaced many of the Re 4/4II series into lesser duties.
The series was introduced as part of the Rail 2000 project, a massive project to modernise and improve capacity on Switzerland's railways. While originally designed as a multipurpose locomotive, they are now used for passenger services only, often in conjunction with the IC 2000 double decker trains (often used to pull InterCity and InterRegio trains in German and French language areas). Their freight role has been assumed by Re 482s. They are maintained at Yverdon.</p>

        <h>MTR Metro Cammell EMU (AC)</h>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/MTR_MLR.JPG" alt="MTR Metro Cammell EMU (AC)" width=700>
<p>The East Rail line Metro Cammell EMU is a model of electric multiple unit built by Metro Cammell for the original Kowloon-Canton Railway (now the East Rail Line) in Hong Kong. The 29 sets are owned by and were originally operated by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC). They have been operated by MTR Corporation (MTRC) after it merged with KCRC in 2007. Although another set of EMU trains from the same manufacturer operate on some of MTR's own lines, there are some significant differences between the two models, with the Metro Cammell EMUs of the original MTR being known as the Modernization Train.
All 29 sets will be retired from service from 2020 and, together with the newer SP1900 EMUs built by Kinki Sharyo, will be replaced by brand-new Hyundai Rotem EMU trains ordered in December 2012. These 37 9-car "R-Trains" are manufactured by the same company as the K-Stock operating on the Tung Chung Line, the Tseung Kwan O Line, and the Kwun Tong Line.
The difference phases of this series of train have entitled with different model numbers, including: 3094 stock, K01 stock, K03 stock and K05 stock.
The MLR is the only electric multiple unit of the Mass Transit Railway that does not have regenerative braking. The difference is obvious due to the lack of motor sound and the presence of air brake sounds while braking.</p>

        <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/291/18423166341_afea127d8f_b.jpg" alt="MTR Rotem EMU">
<p>The Rotem EMU (also known as K-Train/K-Stock) is an electric multiple unit that operates on the MTR rapid transit railway system in Hong Kong. They were jointly built by a consortium consisting of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and Hyundai Rotem of South Korea and come in two variants: those delivered for the Tseung Kwan O line now (but from 2002-2009 used on the Kwun Tong line), and those delivered in 2006 to 2007 for the Tung Chung line. In 2003 and 2004, the urban line trains ran on the Tsuen Wan line, Island line and Tseung Kwan O line.
The K-Stock trains are different from the R-stock trains to be built by Hyundai Rotem for the future North South Corridor, which were ordered by MTRC on 14 December 2012, as 37 nine-car sets and will enter service on the current East Rail line in 2018.</p>
