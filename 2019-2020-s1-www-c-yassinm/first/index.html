 <p>Ingredients </p><

<li>Yeast: Instant yeast makes the job quick, need 1 standard packet.</li>
<li>Water: Use warm water to cut down on rise time, about 105ºF – 115ºF</li>
<li>Flour: Use all-purpose white flour in the pizza crust</li>
<li>Oil: Extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor to the dough, brush the dough with olive oil before adding the toppings</li>>
<li>Salt: Adds flavor.
<li>Sugar: A little sugar increases the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the pizza dough.</li>
<li>Cornmeal: Use cornmeal to dust the pizza pan, pizza crust a gets a little extra flavor and becomes more crisp.</li>

</p> Directions:</p>Prepare the pizza dough through step 6, including preheating the oven to 475F as described in step 4.
Top the dough with the pizza sauce, then the sliced mozzarella, then the shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, then sprinkle with basil.
Bake for 12-15 minutes. For the last minute, I move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges. That's optional.

Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months.<p>
