    <p>Hello My name is Oliver, I am a highschooler. I like to eat, play sports, play videogames, and I love summer. 
    Since I love summer so much I wanted to chose a recipe that was generally easy to make and wasn't too time consuming. 
    First I thought of ice Cream but to make ice cream you need a certain type of machine that was to high in cost. 
    Then I thought popsicles, Popcicles are refreshing, delightful, and easy to make.</p>
