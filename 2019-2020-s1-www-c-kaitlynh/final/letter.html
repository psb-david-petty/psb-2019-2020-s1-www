            <p>My name is Kaitlyn Harris and I reside in Boston Massachusetts, yet attend school in Brookline, a suburb along the outskirts of the city. In all aspects I consider myself a student of life. Throughout my adolescence, my favorite form of learning has been through experiences. Each experience has played a role in influencing the decisions surrounding my passions and the path I want for myself. The central purpose that drove me to make these personal shifts was my desire for peace and direction. As time has passed, Iâ€™ve grown to love the art of self discovery and expression. What began as mere thoughtful self reflection turned to journaling; eventually my exploration encompassed a variety of newly formed hobbies and interests. It was from this wealth of aspiration and search of purpose that birthed my love for yoga and mindfulness. It is my belief that unity amidst peace of body and mind are the root of all things productive. The action of creating balance and expression have sought manifestation in my passions and values so that they may be intertwined with my daily life.</p>
