        <h2><a href="https://rebellion.earth/declaration/">Declaration of Rebellion</a></h2>
        <article class="tree">
          <p><strong>We hold the following to be true:</strong></p>
          <p><strong><em>This is our darkest hour.</em></strong></p>
          <p>Humanity finds itself embroiled in an
event unprecedented in its history. One which, unless immediately addressed, will catapult us further into the destruction
of all we hold dear: this nation, its peoples, our ecosystems and the future of generations to come.</p>
          <p>The science is clear &mdash; we are in the
sixth mass extinction event and we
will face catastrophe if we do not act swiftly and robustly.</p>
          <p>Biodiversity is being annihilated around the world. Our seas are poisoned, acidic and rising. Flooding and desertification will render vast tracts of land uninhabitable and lead to mass migration.</p>
          <p>Our air is so toxic that the United Kingdom is breaking the law. It harms the unborn whilst causing tens of thousands to die. The breakdown of our climate has begun. There will be more wildfires, unpredictable super storms, increasing famine and untold drought as food supplies and fresh water disappear.</p>
          <p>The ecological crises that are impacting upon this nation, and indeed this planet and its wildlife can no longer be ignored, denied nor go unanswered by any beings of sound rational thought, ethical conscience, moral concern, or spiritual belief.</p>
          <p>In accordance with these values, the virtues of truth and the weight of scientific evidence, we declare it our duty to act on behalf of the security and well-being of our children, our communities and the future of the planet itself.</p>
          <p>We, in alignment with our consciences and our reasoning, declare ourselves in rebellion against our Government and
the corrupted, inept institutions that threaten our future.</p>
          <p>The wilful complicity displayed by our government has shattered meaningful democracy and cast aside the common interest in favor of short-term gain
and private profits.</p>
          <p>When Government and the law fail to provide any assurance of adequate protection, as well as security for its people's well-being and the nation's future, it becomes the right of its citizens to seek redress in order to restore dutiful democracy and to secure the solutions needed to avert catastrophe and protect
the future. It becomes not only our right,
it becomes our sacred duty to rebel.</p>
          <p>We hereby declare the bonds of the
social contract to be null and void, which the government has rendered invalid by
its continuing failure to act appropriately.</p>
          <p>We call upon every principled and
peaceful citizen to rise with us.
We demand to be heard, to apply informed solutions to these ecological crises and to create a national assembly by which to initiate those solutions needed to change our present cataclysmic course.</p>
          <p>We refuse to bequeath a dying planet to future generations by failing to act now.</p>
          <p><strong><em>We act in peace, with ferocious love of these lands in our hearts. We act on behalf of life.</em></strong></p>

        <article>
          <p>Climate justice demands that we <em>tell the truth</em> about the climate emergency.</p>
          <p>We are facing an unprecedented global emergency. Life on Earth is in crisis: scientists agree we have entered a period of abrupt climate breakdown, and we are in the midst of a mass extinction of our own making.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://rebellion.earth/act-now/">Act Now</a></h2>
        <article>
          <p>We are unprepared for the danger our future holds. We face floods, wildfires, extreme weather, crop failure, mass displacement and the breakdown of society. The time for denial is over. It is time to act.</p>
          <p>Conventional approaches of voting, lobbying, petitions and protest have failed because powerful political and economic interests prevent change. Our strategy is therefore one of non-violent, disruptive civil disobedience &mdash; a rebellion.</p>
          <p>Historical evidence shows that we need the involvement of 3.5&percnt; of the population to succeed &mdash; in the US that's about 11.5 million people.</p>

          <p>As described in the <em><a href="https://rebellion.earth/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rebel-Starter-Pack-4-September-2019.pdf">XR Rebel Starter Pack</a></em>, 'Extinction Rebellion is an international movement that uses nonviolent civil disobedience in an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimize the risk of social collapse. &hellip;We are completely nonviolent, our actions are done in full public view and we take responsibility for them. &hellip;We [use] nonviolent strategy and tactics as the most effective way to bring about change'.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Extinction Rebellion expect a Citizens' Assembly on the <em>Climate and Ecological Emergency</em> to be implemented in accordance with a <a href="https://rebellion.earth/2019/05/22/basic-standards-for-organising-citizens-assemblies/">minimum set of standards</a>. There are three underlying premises behind them: 1) Democracy is for everyone, 2) In a democracy, people are sovereign, 3) The process should be fair.</p>
          <p>This minimum set of standards is outlined in <em><a href="https://rebellion.earth/2019/05/22/basic-standards-for-organising-citizens-assemblies/">Basic Standards for Organising Citizens' Assemblies</a></em>.</p>
