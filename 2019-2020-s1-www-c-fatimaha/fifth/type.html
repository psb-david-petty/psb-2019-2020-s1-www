             <h2>Electric Cars vs. Gas Cars</h2>
             <article>
                 <p>An immediately apparent difference between EVs and ICEs ( internal combustion engine) is their fuel source,
                 and consequently what you as a consumer use to power your vehicle. ICEs run on
                 gasoline is burned internally to power the car, while EVs run on electricity.
                 Electricity can come from many sources, including from the burning of coal or gas,
                 or from renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower.
                 <br><br>
                 A 2018 study from the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute
                 found that electric vehicles cost less than half as much to operate as gas-powered
                 cars. The average cost to operate an EV in the United States is $485 per year,
                 while the average for a gasoline-powered vehicle is $1,117. </p>
