        <h2>Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) </h2>
        <article>
          <p> Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) are fully-electric vehicles with rechargeable batteries and no gasoline engine.
          Battery electric vehicles store electricity onboard with high-capacity battery packs. Their battery power is used to
          run the electric motor and all onboard electronics. BEVs do not emit any harmful emissions and hazards caused by
          traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. BEVs are charged by electricity from an external source. Electric Vehicle
          (EV) chargers are classified according to the speed with which they recharge an EVs battery.

<br> <br>
The classifications are Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 or DC fast charging. Level 1 EV charging uses a standard household
(120v) outlet to plug into the electric vehicle and takes over 8 hours to charge an EV for approximately 75-80 miles. 
Level one charging is typically done at home or at your workplace. Level 1 chargers have the capability to charge most
EVs on the market.
<br> <br>
Level 2 charging requires a specialized station which provides power at 240v. Level 2 chargers are typically found at
workplaces and public charging stations and will take about 4 hours to charge a battery to 75-80 miles of range.
<br><br>
Level 3 charging, DC fast charging, or simply fast charging is currently the fastest charging solution in the EV market.
DC fast chargers are found at dedicated EV charging stations and charge a battery up to 90 miles range in approximately 30 minutes. </p>
