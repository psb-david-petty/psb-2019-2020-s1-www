        <h2>What is an Electric Car?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Electric vehicles (EV's)have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. 
          The vehicle uses a large traction battery pack to power the electric motor<br> and must be plugged
          in to a charging station or wall outlet to charge. Because it runs on electricity, the vehicle
          emits no exhaust from a tailpipe and does not con-<br>tain the typical liquid fuel components, such
          as a fuel pump, fuel line, or fuel tank. </p>

           <h2> Why Electric Cars?</h2>
          <article>
              <p> Electric vehicles reduce emissions and even save you money.

Fueling with electricity offers some advantages not available in conventional internal combustion <br> engine vehicles.
Because electric motors react quickly, EVs are very responsive and have very good torque.  EVs are often more digitally
connected than conve-<br>ntional vehicles, with many EV charging stations providing the option to control charging from a
smartphone app. 
<br><br>
Just like a smartphone, you can plug in your EV when you get home and have it ready for you to use the next morning.
Since the electric grid is available almo-<br>st anywhere, there are a variety of options for charging: at home, at work
or on the road. By charging often, you may never need to go to a gas station again! 
<br><br>
But EVs provide more than just individual benefits.  EVs can help the United States have a greater diversity of fuel
choices available for transportation. The U.S. <br> used nearly nine billion barrels of petroleum last year, two-thirds
of which went towards transportation. Our reliance on petroleum makes us vulnerable to price<br> spikes and supply
disruptions. EVs help reduce this threat because almost all U.S. electricity is produced from domestic sources,
including coal, nuclear, natural<br> gas, and renewable sources. 
<br><br>
EVs can also reduce the emissions that contribute to climate change and smog, improving public health and reducing
ecological damage. Charging your EV on <br> renewable energy such as solar or wind minimizes these emissions even more.
