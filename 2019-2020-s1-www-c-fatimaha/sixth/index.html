        <h2>What are Electric Vehicles?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Electric vehicles (EV's) have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. 
          The vehicle uses a large traction battery pack to power the electric motor and must be plugged
          in to a charging station or wall outlet to charge. Because it runs on electricity, the vehicle
          emits no exhaust from a tailpipe and does not con-tain the typical liquid fuel components, such
          as a fuel pump, fuel line, or fuel tank. </p>

           <h2> Why Electric Cars?</h2>
          <article>
              <p> Electric vehicles reduce emissions and even save you money.

Fueling with electricity offers some advantages not available in conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.
Because electric motors react quickly, EVs are very responsive and have very good torque.  EVs are often more digitally
connected than conventional vehicles, with many EV charging stations providing the option to control charging from a
smartphone app. 
<br><br>
Just like a smartphone, you can plug in your EV when you get home and have it ready for you to use the next morning.
Since the electric grid is available almost anywhere, there are a variety of options for charging: at home, at work
or on the road. By charging often, you may never need to go to a gas station again! 
<br><br>
But EVs provide more than just individual benefits.  EVs can help the United States have a greater diversity of fuel
choices available for transportation. The U.S. used nearly nine billion barrels of petroleum last year, two-thirds
of which went towards transportation. Our reliance on petroleum makes us vulnerable to price spikes and supply
disruptions. EVs help reduce this threat because almost all U.S. electricity is produced from domestic sources,
including coal, nuclear, natural gas, and renewable sources. 
<br><br>
EVs can also reduce the emissions that contribute to climate change and smog, improving public health and reducing
ecological damage. Charging your EV on renewable energy such as solar or wind minimizes these emissions even more.
