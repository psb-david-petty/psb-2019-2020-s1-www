</div>




<div class="packages" id="SPECIAL">
    
    <div>
   <b>S</b> is for STRENGTH, my current strength is medium-high. High for my height, but for medium for my age. Therefore I can be used as a great sabotage as I may be severly underestimaed by your foes. I am active and can participate in sports and other basic activities that require movement.
</div>

<p>

<div>
   <b>P</b> is for PERCEPTION, my current perception is medium. Most of my senses are pretty good. I do not quite have 20/20 vision, but close with a small prescription of only -0.75. My hearing is adequate as my mother and grandmother are both kind of deaf, and I'm probably on my way. My taste however is quite keen, and I can reccomend the most delectable dishes. My ability to smell is excellent, if there's a gas leak, I'll be the first to notify. 
</div>

<p>

<div>
   <b>E</b> is for ENDURANCE, my current endurance is high. I am able to run faily long distances without tiring. This again can be useful for active actions. I have a strong emotional endurance as well, as my brain stamina will keep me energetic and entertaining all all night long! (All services cease after 2:00am)
</div>

<p>
    
<div>
   <b>C</b> is for CHARISMA, my current charisma is extremely-high. I have told by many that I am "a blast to be around" as well as "laugh out loud."  This again can be useful for active actions. I have a strong emotional endurance as well, as my brain stamina will keep me energetic and entertaining all all night long (All services cease after 2:00am)
</div>

<p>

<div>
   <b>I</b> is for INTELLIGENCE, my current intelligence is high. Academcally, I am . This intelligence allows me to come up with . I catch on to things easily and can ease right into inside jokes and group routines. 
</div>



<div>
   <b>A</b> is for ATTENIVENESS, my current attentivenss is med-high. Nowadays, especially among teenagers, attention spans are increasignly fleeding. This leads to people deafaulting to checking their phones every minute, sacrficing precious time and social interaction. I hope to bring a more social vibe to every group that I visit, transforming a bunch of individuals into one large team. 
</div>

<p>

<div>
   <b>L</b> is for LOYALTY, unfortunately, due to business reasons, my current loyalty is low. I cannot guarentee a return to the group until all transactions are confirmed. If there is consistent payment, however, and I am requested to return to the same group, I will be able to remember names and basic information about my customers. Remember, at the end of a day this is a business first, and a friendship second.
