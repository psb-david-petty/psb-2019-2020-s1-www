  <p style="color:#f7f7f7;">In the game you play as Link, the young hero of the land known as Hyrule, a once flourishing kingdom sprawling with life and peace. 10,000 years before the game takes place, an incarnation of Link defeated the evil and powerful foe Ganon, and with the help of the princess, an incarnation of Zelda, seals him away. Fast forward to 100 years before the game, Ganon has returned, powerful as ever in the form of Calamity Ganon. Link is defeated in combat, and must heal at the Shrine of Ressurection for 100 years. He wakes up to a Hyrule left in shambles from the destruction of Calamity Ganon. He must act quickly, and defeat the antagonist at Hyrule Castle. In the center of the kingdom, Princess Zelda awaits her savior at the castle, needing the aid of the courageous hero.</p>

      <h2 style="text-align:center;">WHAT MAKES BREATH OF THE WILD SO GREAT? </h2>
  <p>There are many factors as to why Breath of the Wild was so widely sucessful. Incredible game direction by Hidemaro Fujibayashi. which as previously mentioned, won him the 2017 award for just that. Paired together with an unforgettable soundtrack by Hajime Wakai and of course, another amazing production by the legends themselves: the late former president of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata, Zelda's (And Mario's!) creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Eji Anouma, the current king of Zelda. All these great minds combinbed with an amazing team of hundreds of others created the best Zelda game, arguably best Nintendo game, and what I would call the greatest video game of all time. And, an amazing part of Breath of the Wild's brilliance is the simply the gameplay.</p>

  <p style="color:#f7f7f7;">Breath of the Wild is such an innovative game because it truly broke the standards of Zelda, and video gaming in general. The devs said that their goal when design BOTW was to return to the style of gamelpay that they created in the original 1986's "The Legend of Zelda" on the NES. In this game, the player was free to choose their path and adventure any way they liked. The game was what is known as "open world" a style of video games that allows the player to approach the game in any way they like. Ever since then, Zelda games have folowed a linear gameplay format, in which different sections of the game are unlocked slowly over time. After oveer 30 years of Zelda, Nintendo finally released another open world game, Breath of the Wild. The gameplay is so fluid and natural, with subtle control reminders that can be toggled off for more experienced players. The game is also widely known for it's amazing tutorial stage, The Great Plateau. This section of the game perfectly eases the player into the world and teaches the player how the game works in a "show not tell" way. Another innovative aspect of the game is the runes. The player is given five powerful "runes," superpowers if you will. You are able to manipulate any metal object with Magnesis, summon remote detonated bombs, pause any movable object or enemy with Stasis, summon ice blocks on any body of water with Cryonis, and even take pictures with a camera. These runes combined with your bow, sword, shield, and paraglider make for a truly free and interesting gaming experience.</p>

      <h2 style="text-align:center;">GAME DEVELOPMENT</h2>
  <p>Of course, the reason the game is as great as it is is because of the incredibly talented dev team. They worked on Breath of the Wild for five long years, perfecting game design, art and style, physics, open air, gameplay, SFX, and that remarkable soundtrack. Their hard work does show in the game, as there are many moments where you can tell that the devs poured their hearts into this game. Whether it's little easter eggs, clever and funny dialougue, or breathtaking full scale advanced cutscenes, the work shows. They somehow manage to make the game feel like a real world, packing it chalk-full with creatures, monsters, NPCS, and stunnjing enviortments. There is even a 7 part werb series that gies into the behind the scens of development. With Eji Anouma at the helm, it's no surprise that the game turned out to be the masterpiece that it is.</p>
