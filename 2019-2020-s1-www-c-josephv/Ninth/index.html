  <p>Cosmo Luigi Viola is a beautiful, squishy, little pug who currently resides in Brookline, MA. His favorite activities include sleeping, eating, chewing bones, going to the beach in RI, long walks by the water, and playing chasing games. He is seven years old and in good health. He does have addison's disease which requires him to take a daily pill and monthly injection. He is still very active and happy, though. </p>

  <span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:25px;color: #f7f7f7;">ORIGINS</span>
  
  <p style="color:#f7f7f7;">Cosmo was born on May 21st, 2012. He is is the son of Jack and Cheerio, both pure bred show dogs, Jack of which has won many awards at numerous dog shows. My family officially decided on adopting a dog in March of 2012, after my sister and I broke down crying, upset that all of our close friends had dogs, except for us. In April, we decided on a pug, a small, cute, and relatively easy dog to take care of. My mom got in contact with a breeder who was expecting a litter very soon, the puppies of which would be ready in August</p>

  <p style="color: #f7f7f7;">Cosmo loves attention, so if he was able to comprehend it, he would be very thankful for you spending time to learn about him. He has been such a significant part of my life, and I’m so glad that we decided to get him. He always there for companionship, stress, or sadness. I think it’s safe to say that he’s a very important part of the family, and we all hope we have many more amazing years with our pug.</p>
