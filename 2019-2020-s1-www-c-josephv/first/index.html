    <h1>About ME</h1>
    
    <p>Hi, my name is Joe. I am a sophomore student at <a href="http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/">Brookline High School</a>. Hi, my name is Joe. I’m a sophomore at Brookline High School. I’ve lived in brookline my entire life. Well technically, not my entire life, because I was born in Cambridge. I was born in Cambridge, in a car actually. A 2000 Subaru Outback to be specific. This isn’t really my first webpage. Over the years I have learned saxophone, Spanish, running techniques, how to raise a pug, and comedy-gold. I am also the co-founder and Cheif Technological Officer of <a

<p>When I was 8 years old, I adopted my dog, Cosmo. He is a very cute pug with great textures. He is squishy and soft to the touch, a perfect mix. This is a picture of Cosmo: </p>

<p>I spend a lot of time with Cosmo, and the rest of my family. I love going on vacations with my family every summer and usually every February. I also love hanging out with my friends. I have awesome friends, and we have so much fun messing around, playing games, or whatever.</p>
